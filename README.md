Python Challenge - UC Berkeley Data Science BootCamp - Week 3

PyBank
Revenue

In this challenge, we are tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company. Set of financial data called budget_data.csv is stored in the resources folder. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. 

The main.py python script analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

*The total number of months included in the dataset

*The net total amount of “Profit/Losses” over the entire period

*Calculate the changes in “Profit/Losses” over the entire period, then find the average of those changes

*The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

*The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

  Financial Analysis
  ----------------------------
  Total Months: 86
  Total: $38382578
  Average  Change: $-2315.12
  Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
  Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)

In addition, the script also generates a .txt file with the summary in the analysis folder.

Vote Counting

In this challenge, we were tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process.

A set of poll data called election_data.csv is in the resources folder. The dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. The main.py Python script analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

*The total number of votes cast

*A complete list of candidates who received votes

*The percentage of votes each candidate won

*The total number of votes each candidate won

*The winner of the election based on popular vote.



Ex:
  Election Results
  -------------------------
  Total Votes: 3521001
  -------------------------
  Khan: 63.000% (2218231)
  Correy: 20.000% (704200)
  Li: 14.000% (492940)
  O'Tooley: 3.000% (105630)
  -------------------------
  Winner: Khan

Main.py script also prints analysis to the terminal and exports a text file with the results in the Analysis folder.
